As a UX rule of thumb, always assume your user will need special help to achieve even the simplest of tasks.

Much like helping a drunk friend brush their teeth, assume that your user is (acting like) a non-technical bumbling fool.

Like your drunk buddy, guide them through 'common sense' activities and make it next to **impossible** for them to get tripped up.

## You are clear and sober

You've probably spent countless hours honing your design, making sure the flow is perfect.

Kudos! **You should be doing this.**

However, this comes with a cost:

**You become too familiar with your interface.**

What might be obvious to you might escape the drunk user.

## How to fix?

- Back away. Take a breath
- Get a brand-spankin' new person to drive through your product
- Watch silently as they fail and encounter fiction
- Take notes about these points of friction
- Fix them
- Rinse then Repeat

Get into the mindset of the 'drunk' user.

Start to imagine where things could go wrong and fix those sharp edges.

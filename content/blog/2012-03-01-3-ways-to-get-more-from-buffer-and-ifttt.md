It is no secret, I'm a huge fan of the service <a href="http://bit.ly/zg74p6">Buffer</a>. I tweet about it constantly and I use it for most of the content I share through twitter.

<div class="LessonSummary">

If you aren't familiar with Buffer, the service lets you stagger out tweets to go out at specified times rather than whenever you are reading the content. I typically do my blog reading in chunks and will have about 5 to 6 different posts I want to share but don't want to take the time to schedule them out or I'm on a mobile device where scheduling tweets is painful.

Buffer was the solution. It lets me reach my audience at peak traffic times and not over-tweet my followers at any one time.

I recently discovered an app called ifttt, that enabled me to supercharge <a href="http://bit.ly/zg74p6">Buffer</a>, amongst other web services, to the next level.

Using <a href="http://bit.ly/zg74p6">Buffer</a> and <a href="http://ifttt.com/">Ifttt</a> together can help you streamline a ton of tedious social media minutia, get shit done, and get back to your day.

Below are the top 3 Recipes I've found to make Ifttt and <a href="http://bit.ly/zg74p6">Buffer</a> a dynamic duo.

This recipe I made myself (*pat on back*). With it, any tweet that I send out with the hastag #RT will get added to my buffer to be sent out in a couple of days.

Very handy for automatically re-sharing some content (like this post) that I spent time creating at a later date to get the most leverage out of it.

I choose the #RT in the hopes that people would also retweet the post.

<strong>The great thing about all of the recipes in ifttt is that you can customize any of the steps, which means you can change the hashtag to whatever you want.</strong>

Bad things happen in life. Sometimes more often than good.

What you do with the bad situations is what will define you.

1.  **Letting failure destroy you** - this cannot be the case. Typically nothing great was achieved on the first try. Failure is bound with future success.
2.  **Being defined by your failure** - This is sheer insanity. Things happen. Move on. Being defined as a failure by others is only true if you never try again.
3.  **Learning from failure** - failing fast and iterating quickly are skills that need to be in your toolbox.

Which will you choose? This is a rhetorical question.

<p>Want IDE autocompletion without typescript or flow?</p>

Now you can!

I've created an [atom plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-react-autocomplete) that uses your component propTypes to autocomplete!

This works with any react component that has propTypes, and it works on a per-project basis for autocompleting isn't full of junk from unused components.

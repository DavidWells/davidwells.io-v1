> "No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man." -Heraclitus Of Ephesus

Everything that you do, whether it is for the first time or the hundredth, is a unique experience, or at least it <strong>could be.</strong>

It's hard to envision remedial repetitive tasks in your day to day life as different. The fact remains, though; you are different than you were yesterday, and the task at hand doesn't have to play out like it always does.

A culmination of the experiences of yesterday has shaped you into the person you are today.

Each moment a drop in the bucket that is you.

You shape those moments and have the power to influence the way they play out.

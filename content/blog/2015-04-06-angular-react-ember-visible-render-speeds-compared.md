<blockquote><strong>Preface:</strong> This isn't anywhere near conclusive evidence. Please test and play with the different frameworks (libs) yourself to see for yourself.</blockquote>
While evaluating different front-end Javascript frameworks/libraries, I came across some talks and demos that I found rather interesting. Particularly when it came to speed comparisons.
<blockquote><strong>Note</strong>: Angular and React are vastly different frameworks (react calls itself a library) and comparing them straight up is comparing apples to oranges. Same goes for ember and react</blockquote>
That said, I use and love React. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with any of the frameworks mentioned. <strong>AKA</strong> <strong>HackerNews please don't kill me.</strong>

Watch the videos below and take away from them what you will.

Let me know if you have any other links/resources for comparisons in the comments below.

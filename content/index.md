> **TL;DR** – Marketing nerd turned full stack developer & entrepreneur.

I'm working with [Netlify](http://netlify.com) as a technical product manager, where I help steer the direction of what we are building, get my hands dirty with code & help to educate folks on JAMStack & serverless technologies.

Previously, I was working as a full stack developer & dev advocate at [Serverless](http://serverless.com). Before that, I was the lead developer on the UI/UX team at [Mulesoft](http://www.mulesoft.com), building their design system.

Before that, I founded [Inbound Now](http://www.inboundnow.com), where we built a variety of open-source marketing tools.

Before learning to code, I was a marketing consultant working at [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com). I've helped hundreds of companies with their content strategy, conversion rate optimization, and inbound lead generation.

Today, I focus on **serverless cloud architecture**, **user experience**, and **product development**

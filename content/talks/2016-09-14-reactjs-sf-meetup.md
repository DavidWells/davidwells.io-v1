# Building static sites with React

David will be talking about building static web sites with React and why pairing React + Webpack + markdown + git is increasingly the workflow of choice for frontend web devs building dynamic static sites.

He will explore how to build React-powered static sites with phenomic.io and demo the stack that powers the new serverless.com

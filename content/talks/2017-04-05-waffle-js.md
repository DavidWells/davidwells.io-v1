Learn how new “serverless” tech to boost your self-esteem. There are some cool new ways for devs to build apps without needing to focus on or worry about devOps, scaling, or paying hourly for serverless. This talk will talk about how you might be able to use some of these new “function as a service” providers (AWS, Google, IBM, Microsoft, etc) in your next (work or personal) project. 🎉

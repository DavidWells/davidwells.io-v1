The popular interpretation of Serverless is Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) where developers can upload code that is run within Compute containers that are triggered by a variety of events, are ephemeral and fully managed by the cloud platform.  

As serverless technology moves past the emerging technology phase there are more and more great real world examples out there. David Wells, Senior Software Engineer at Serverless Inc., will explore some different use cases for serverless technology with examples from companies and other open source projects.

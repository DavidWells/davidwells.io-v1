# Bulletproof CSS with React and CSS Modules

CSS is notoriously troublesome to work with. It can get complicated quickly, and style clashes + inheritance problems start stacking up. Throw in running your CSS in a third party environment and you're gonna have a bad time.

David Wells focuses on how you can eliminate these common CSS issues FOREVER, and will explore how this works with React-powered static site generator phenomic.io

We all know how AWS revolutionized the way we build and deploy software applications. It reduced the barrier to entry by eliminating the need to purchase or maintain physical servers. But Lambda takes it a step further.

In this workshop, you'll learn how to deploy your applications as independent functions, that respond to events, charge you only when they run, and scale automatically. The open source Serverless Framework helps to facilitate this and simplifies the deployment to Lambda -- all from the comfort of your command line.

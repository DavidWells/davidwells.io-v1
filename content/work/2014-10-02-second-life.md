# SecondLife

**Client:** SecondLife via Exygy

**Date:** 2014

**Tags:** Site, PHP, WordPress

This was a WordPress site build for Exygy.

We used advanced custom fields in a pretty cool way to give the client 100%(ish) control over page layout.

We also had to incorporate multi-language functionality into the site.

I was in charge of speccing out the site build and managing the build process. The design was from SecondLife

Advanced custom fields flexible content areas gave the ability to modularly build out the site and allow for drag and dropping of areas for the client

### ACF Flexible Sections

Each section can be clone, reordered, or filled with different content. This means a huge huge number of different page layouts with a single page template.
